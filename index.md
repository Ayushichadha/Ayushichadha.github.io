  <div class="intro-line">Hi, I'm Ayushi, a researcher exploring cognitive reasoning cores, where intelligence is an algorithm.</div>
  <div class="intro-text">
    <p>I'm exploring the idea of personalized AI devices that exhibit fluid intelligence. These are systems that merge with human cognition, augmenting attention, memory, reasoning, and imagination in ways that feel continuous rather than external. I see intelligence as something that should live close to the body and mind, context-aware, adaptive, and evolving alongside the person using it.</p>
    <p>My work approaches this symbiosis from multiple angles: building compact reasoning systems, studying how goals and cognition shift over time, and imagining interfaces and machines where human and artificial intelligence form a single, extended cognitive loop.</p>
