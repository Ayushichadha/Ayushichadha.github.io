## Welcome

Hi, I'm **Ayushi**, an independent researcher exploring small reasoning systems — models that trade encyclopedic memory for stronger algorithms of intelligence: planning, subgoals, and adaptive problem solving.

## Current Work

I'm developing a **Subgoal-Augmented Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)**, which combines:

- A brain-inspired recurrent architecture with fast/slow processing pathways
- A feudal-style subgoal head that explicitly coordinates high- and low-level reasoning
- Feudal loss supervision to improve planning and coordination

### Getting Started

- 👉 **[Full Research Details »]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/)** — Architecture, mathematics, experiments, and results
- 📝 **[About Me »]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/)** — Background and research interests
- 🔗 **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Ayushichadha/scout)** — Code and implementation

This site is a living notebook for my experiments, notes, and ideas as I learn and build.
