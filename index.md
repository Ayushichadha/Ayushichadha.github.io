Hi, I’m **Ayushi**, an independent researcher exploring small reasoning systems — models that trade encyclopedic memory for stronger algorithms of intelligence: planning, subgoals, and adaptive problem solving.

Right now I’m working on a **subgoal-augmented Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)**, combining:

- a brain-inspired recurrent architecture with fast/slow pathways, and  
- a feudal-style subgoal head that explicitly coordinates high- and low-level reasoning.

This site is a living notebook for my experiments, notes, and ideas as I learn and build.
