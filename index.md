    <p>I am obsessed with the idea of personalized AI devices that exhibit fluid intelligence.</p>
    <p>Not systems that replace human thinking, but ones that merge with it, augmenting attention, memory, reasoning, and imagination in ways that feel continuous rather than external. I think of intelligence as something that should live close to the body and mind, adapt with context, and evolve alongside the person using it.</p>
    <p>My work explores this symbiosis from multiple angles: building compact reasoning systems, studying how goals and cognition shift over time, and imagining interfaces and machines where human and artificial intelligence form a single, extended cognitive loop.</p>
    <p>This portfolio is a snapshot of that pursuit.</p>

Hi, I'm **Ayushi**, an independent researcher exploring small reasoning systems — models that trade encyclopedic memory for stronger algorithms of intelligence: planning, subgoals, and adaptive problem solving.
